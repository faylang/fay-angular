This is a stub package for making AngularJS bindings to Fay.

If you would like to help out, send an e-mail to adam@edea.se and I will give you push access. You can decide if you want to simply push, or open up pull requests if you want code reviews.

Feel free to open up issues for discussions and questions here, no matter if they are related to Angular or just general Fay things. This should be a good place to have these discussions, people who are interested can watch the repo or check the issue list instead of us trying to gather elsewhere.

==========
